        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>Player 2 found player 1's GitHub profile and found the fireside-story repository.
            They then cloned down the repository locally and added something awesome to the story,
            and also committed and pushed up those changes back to me.</p>
        <p>But while we were having some trouble locating the collaboration invitation from player 1,
            they decided to keep practing adding to the repo, adding and then committing the changes through their local terminal,
            and then pushing up the changes so the other player will be able to use them as well. Hopefully
            when the other player accepts the invitation, there are no problems caused by player one practicing pushing up
            changes to the repository.</p>
